  fixed : map modification in frm functions (addmarker...) now works
  fixed : asynchronous actions (ie: address resolution) were bypassed by synchronous
          ie: addMarker[string address], enableScrollWheelZoom => before address is resolved, enableScrollWheelZoom starts
          => added a stack manager which push all actions and start next one once previous is finished.
