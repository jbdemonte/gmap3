[gmap3](http://gmap3.net/) - Google Maps and jQuery
===================================================

Presentation
------------

gmap3 is a plugin for jQuery which allows you to use the Google maps API easily.
It provides some powerful functions (clustering...) and some simple ones to avoid writing lots of repetitive code.
However, it still allows you to use all of the Google Maps API.


Why use gmap3?
-----------------

1. Full jQuery:
 - the same map can be accessed by all possible selectors
 - jQuery calls can be stacked

2. Full Google Maps API
 - While gmap3 provides easier access, Google Maps formats and objects are still usable

3. Silent use of Google Maps services
 - Google Maps services are usable without any code (address resolution, elevation ...) ([example of silent address resolution](http://gmap3.net/api/add-marker.html))

4. Tags & custom data
 - All objects added (markers, overlays ...) can be tagged in order to get it later through a "get" function filtered by one or more tags ([example of tags](http://gmap3.net/api/add-kml-layer.html))
 - All objects can embed custom data which are sent on events ([example of custom data](http://gmap3.net/api/add-markers.html))

5. Many examples
 - on the website [API](http://gmap3.net/api.html) and [Examples](http://gmap3.net/examples.html)
